Respondent Level Data\n\nThis table has all responses for the 23/24 participation survey.\n\nThe Participation Survey is a continuous push-to-web survey of adults aged 16 and over in England. It serves as a successor to the Taking Part survey, which ran for 16 years as a continuous face to face survey. Paper surveys are available for those not digitally engaged. Fieldwork started in October 2021 and it is envisaged that the survey will be a key evidence source for Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and its sectors by providing statistically representative national estimates of adult engagement with the DCMS sectors. The survey\u2019s main objectives are to:\n\n* Provide a central, reliable evidence source that can be used to analyse cultural, digital, and sporting engagement, providing a clear picture of why people do or do not engage.\n* Provide data at a county level to meet user needs, including providing evidence for the levelling up agenda.\n* Underpin further research on driving engagement and the value and benefits of engagement.\n\nFurther information on the survey can be found on the gov.uk [Participation Survey](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/participation-survey) webpage.\n", "columns": {"archycserial": {"name": "archycserial", "description": "Unique serial number with year identifier (Archive)", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "archindivserial": {"name": "archindivserial", "description": "Unique serial number (Archive)", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "archhhserial": {"name": "archhhserial", "description": "HHSerial (Archive)", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "year": {"name": "year", "description": "Fieldwork year (sample issue)", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "quarter": {"name": "quarter", "description": "Quarter of sample issue", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "wave": {"name": "wave", "description": "Wave", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "dill_dv": {"name": "dill_dv", "description": "Dill_DV", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "mode": {"name": "mode", "description": "Online or paper mode", "meta": {}, "data_type": "int", "constraints": [], "quote": null, "tags": [], "granularity": null}, "subsample": {"name": "subsample", "description": "SubSample.

Introduction\n\nThis documentation summarises the data which has been brought together for the West Midlands Cultural Sector Research Project 2.0 and the process used to do so.\n\n\n\n## How to use this website\n\nBy clicking on the **Database** button on the left hand side you can view the content of the database.\n\nThe tables are grouped into 4 schemas\n1. **public**: contains the preprocessed source data\n2. **public_staging**: contains initial data models\n3. **public_warehouse**: contains intermediate data models\n4. **public_marts**: contains the final data models\n\nThe data used for the project is in the final data models in public_marts. If you click on any of the tables in the public_marts schema you can then see documentation about the source and contents of that table, including:\n* The source of the data\n* The columns present the table with a description of their content\n\nIn the bottom right-hand side of the page there is a **View Lineage Graph** button which shows you the flow of data from the raw data to the marts. If you click on a table in this graph you can see how other tables were combined to produce this output.\n\n\n## Data Sources\n\n| Data Theme            | Data Source                                 | Link                                                                                                                                       |\n| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Funding               | Arts Council England NPO Funding            | https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/how-we-invest-public-money/2023-26-Investment-Programme/2023-26-investment-programme-data                   |\n| Funding               | Arts Council England Project Grants Funding | https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ProjectGrants/project-grants-data                                                                           |\n| Funding               | 360Giving                                   | https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/                                                                                                     |\n| Demographics          | Census 2021                                 | https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk                                                                                        |\n| Demographics          | Annual Survey Economic Data                 | https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=17                                                 |\n| Demographics          | Annual Personal Wellbeing Estimates         | https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/datasets/headlineestimatesofpersonalwellbeing                                |\n| Place Characteristics | Cultural and Place Data Explorer            | https://culture.localinsight.org/#/map                                                                                                     |\n| Place Characteristics | Indices of Multiple Deprivation             | https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=17                                                 |\n| Place Characteristics | Rural Urban Classification                  | https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::rural-urban-classification-2011-of-msoas-in-ew/about                                     |\n| Place Characteristics | Levelling Up and Priority Places            | https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/your-area/priority-places-and-levelling-culture-places#t-in-page-nav-3                                      |\n| Area Mapping          | ONS Postcode Directory (November 2024)      | https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/b54177d3d7264cd6ad89e74dd9c1391d/about                                                        |\n| Area Mapping          | MSOA to Local Authority District Mapping    | https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::msoa-2011-to-msoa-2021-to-local-authority-district-2022-exact-fit-lookup-for-ew-v2/about |\n\n\n\n## West Midlands areas and codes\nThere are 30 lower tier local authority areas and 14 upper tier local authority areas in the West Midlands area, with 7 of them together forming the West Midlands Combined Authority.

In this tab, you can see all of the\nmodels defined in your dbt project, as well as models imported from dbt packages.\n\n#### Database Tab\nThe `Database` tab also exposes your models, but in a format that looks more like a database explorer. This view\nshows relations (tables and views) grouped into database schemas. Note that ephemeral models are _not_ shown\nin this interface, as they do not exist in the database.\n\n### Graph Exploration\nYou can click the blue icon on the bottom-right corner of the page to view the lineage graph of your models.\n\nOn model pages, you'll see the immediate parents and children of the model you're exploring. By clicking the `Expand`\nbutton at the top-right of this lineage pane, you'll be able to see all of the models that are used to build,\nor are built from, the model you're exploring.\n\nOnce expanded, you'll be able to use the `--select` and `--exclude` model selection syntax to filter the\nmodels in the graph. For more information on model selection, check out the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/model-selection-syntax).\n\nNote that you can also right-click on models to interactively filter and explore the graph.\n\n---\n\n### More information\n\n- [What is dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)?\n- Read the [dbt viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint)\n-
