      # Arts Council England NPO Funding
      
      This table contains the amount of Arts Council England funding provided to
      NPOs, grouped by local authority district.

      Data is grouped by local authority district as there are not enough entries
      in the data to populate at the MSOA level i.e. the majority of MSOAs will have
      zero funding, which is not informative when it comes to analysing the data.

      # Census 2021 Data

      Contains data from the 2021 Census at the MSOA level.

      ### Census data margin of error

      The raw data for the census is provided as counts for each category
      along with the total sample size count for that census question. For
      example:

      [Distance travelled to work]{.underline}

      Total people who responded about distance travelled to work: 2829

      People who answered "less than 2km": 118

      We combined these counts with the estimated population for each
      MSOA[^17] to calculate the margin of error for each answer using a
      finite population correction. The margin of error provided is a 95%
      confidence level.

      height="0.7533377077865266in"}

      *Figure 3: Formula for calculating margin of error with finite
      population correction*

      #### Census age data

      The grouped age data in the Census didn't match perfectly onto the age
      groups for the participation survey.

      So, instead of using the pre-grouped age data, we began with the year by
      year age data and grouped them together to match the participation
      survey as part of the preprocessing.

      The result is age data grouped into 5 year bins to match the
      participation survey data.

      The GrantNav portal allows for the searching of funding awards by funder, region and date.
      We carried out a search for funding awards in the West Midlands in the previous year.

      A funder must be registered to submit their data to this service for it to be present, 
      so there will likely be additional funding from other funders which have not submitted
      their data.
      
      The table contains funding data from The Foyle Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation,
      and Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.

      2. Worthwhile: Overall, to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile, where 0 is "not at all worthwhile" and 10 is "completely worthwhile"?
      3. Happiness: Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday, where 0 is "not at all happy" and 10 is "completely happy"?
      4. Anxiety: On a scale where 0 is "not at all anxious" and 10 is "completely anxious", overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?
