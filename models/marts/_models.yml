      # Arts Council England NPO Funding
      
      This table contains the amount of Arts Council England funding provided to
      NPOs, grouped by local authority district.

      Data is grouped by local authority district as there are not enough entries
      in the data to populate at the MSOA level i.e. the majority of MSOAs will have
      zero funding, which is not informative when it comes to analysing the data.

      ### Margin of error calculation

      The raw data for the census is provided as counts for each category
      along with the total sample size count for that census question.

      We combined these counts with the estimated population for each
      MSOA to calculate the margin of error for each answer using a
      finite population correction.

      The finite population correction accounts for the fact that a
      large proportion of the total population is included in the sample.
      
      For example:

      **Distance travelled to work**

      ```
      - Population of MSOA: N = 3500
      - Total people who responded about distance travelled to work: n = 2829
      - People who answered "less than 2km": 118
      - Proportion of people who answered "less than 2km": p = 118 / 2829 = 0.042

      MOE = z * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / ((N - 1) / (n / (N - n))))
      MOE = 1.96 * sqrt(0.042 * (1 - 0.042) / ((3500 - 1) / (2829 / (3500 - 2829))))
      MOE = 1.36%
      ```

      The margin of error provided is at a 95% confidence level.

      #### Census age data

      The grouped age data in the Census didn't match perfectly onto the age
      groups for the participation survey.

      So, instead of using the pre-grouped age data, we began with the year by
      year age data and grouped them together to match the participation
      survey as part of the preprocessing.

      The result is age data grouped into 5 year bins to match the
      participation survey data.

      We carried out a search for funding awards in the West Midlands in the previous year.

      A funder must be registered to submit their data to this service for it to be present, 
      so there will likely be additional funding from other funders which have not submitted
      their data.
      
      The table contains funding data from The Foyle Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation,
      and Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.

      # Indices of Deprivation

      A table containing values for the ONS indices of multiple deprivation for each MSOA.

      For the ease of use, the deprivation scores are typically ranked into deciles or quantiles,
      providing a simple ranking of 1-10 or 1-5 for an area based on how the deprivation score
      sits compared to other areas.

      # Annual Population Survey Wellbeing Estimates

      A table containing averages for the four ONS wellbeing measures for each local authority.

      The wellbeing measures and their associated questions are as follows:
      1. Life satisfaction: Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays, where 0 is "not at all satisfied" and 10 is "completely satisfied"?
      2. Worthwhile: Overall, to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile, where 0 is "not at all worthwhile" and 10 is "completely worthwhile"?
      3. Happiness: Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday, where 0 is "not at all happy" and 10 is "completely happy"?
      4. Anxiety: On a scale where 0 is "not at all anxious" and 10 is "completely anxious", overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?

      # Participation Survey Respondent Level Data

      This table has all responses for the 23/24 participation survey.

      The Participation Survey is a continuous push-to-web survey of adults aged 16 and over in England. It serves as a successor to the Taking Part survey, which ran for 16 years as a continuous face to face survey. Paper surveys are available for those not digitally engaged. Fieldwork started in October 2021 and it is envisaged that the survey will be a key evidence source for Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and its sectors by providing statistically representative national estimates of adult engagement with the DCMS sectors. The survey’s main objectives are to:

      * Provide a central, reliable evidence source that can be used to analyse cultural, digital, and sporting engagement, providing a clear picture of why people do or do not engage.
      * Provide data at a county level to meet user needs, including providing evidence for the levelling up agenda.
      * Underpin further research on driving engagement and the value and benefits of engagement.

      Further information on the survey can be found on the gov.uk [Participation Survey](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/participation-survey) webpage.
